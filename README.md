#Good News
Colab upgraded from the original K80 12G to T4 16G, faster, more VRAM！  

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide a way to run ***DeepFaceLab*** for free.  
When you have learned how to use DFL, Perhaps the biggest limitation for you is the Computer performance.  
Highly equipped graphics cards are very expensive, and cloud services are not cheap.  

So how free? take this!^_^ Of course there are some restrictions  

The code comes from ***DeepFaceLab*** and ***DeepFaceLab_Linux*** .  
This rep just add the .ipynb file ,makes it simpler!  
No need to copy, zip, unzip multiple times, no need to worry about data loss. 

# Features
* You can use tesla k80 for free
* Your data is saved in the google Drive
* You can preview the results online,No need to download
* Colaboratory requires interaction when in use. The system may stop long-running background calculations
* Sometimes,The first load(train load) may be slower .

# Guide
1. First, You need a google account  
2. Secend,you need a [DeepFaceLab_Colab.ipynb](https://github.com/dream80/DeepFaceLab_Colab/blob/master/DeepFaceLab_Colab.ipynb) file  
3. Third,  Click ***Open in Colab***  ，Run it！
4. Fourth, Run [ViewLastHistory.ipynb](https://github.com/dream80/DeepFaceLab_Colab/blob/master/ViewLastHistory.ipynb) file,Check out the latest results.
5. Sixth,Continue training  Step 6 of using the DeepFaceLab_Colab.ipynb file!
